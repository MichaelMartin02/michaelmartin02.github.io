        <p>Timothy is a 29 year old, unemployed man who is taking some time to find himself and is wanting to go on a road trip across the country. He is interested in the novelties and oddities of the world around him, as he is an “author”. He wants to go on a trip without any real destination, and merely wants to explore different attractions while on a tight budget. He is very tech savvy, but his 7 year old cell phone and his windows xp-era laptop struggle with modern websites, so he wants to plan a trip quickly and with little effort. He wants to see more scenic parts of the country, wanting to avoid cities.</p><br>

      <p>Find a large animal in PA and view its details on the map<br><br>

      You want to go on a road trip Kutztown to Arizona. You only want to drive for 6 hours a day, and you want to visit a lot of “worlds largest” animals as you are an animal lover. Create a trip that matches these preferences.<br><br>
      
     As you are planning your trip and choosing the attractions you want to go to, you reach a point where neither of the provided options seems attractive to you. Have the app give you different options for the stop you are at.<br><br>
      
     As you are choosing what attractions you want to visit, you realize that the app hasn’t given you the option to stop at a place you had in mind, and you want to add it to your trip.<br><br>
      
      As soon as you finish planning your trip, your spouse asks that you remove the first stop you chose from the itinerary. Remove the first stop you chose from your trip</p>
